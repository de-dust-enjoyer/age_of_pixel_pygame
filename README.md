small remake of the iconic age of war game

if you want to play it, python must be installed and you also need to have pygame

after installing python open console and type:

pip install pygame

if this doesnt work type:

pip3 install pygame


the purpose of this project is to teach myself python while builbing a fun little game.

I am aware that the code quality is quite poor because this is my first project am I am still a beginner.

I am open for feedback :)
